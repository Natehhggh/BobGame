Simple game idea based on the bobiverse book series, as an excuse to writing a game engine,
this is broadly an educational codebase as I learn more about the concepts. and maybe something will happen with the game part as I go.
Mind my mess as this is an amporbious blob of code atm, since there's a lot to do, and the idea of what is a "Game Engine" is kinda vague sometimes.

I'm trying to make a framework that works with my workflow, thats more code first than tools like unity/unreal. and I just prefer to understand how my tools work

the 'game' portion is written on top of the engine as a driver for what features to add or redesign.


Next steps
- [ ] Improved Shader systems
- [ ] Convert from Raylib to OpenGL? Maybe
- [ ] Sound system
- [ ] Better Asset management system than hard coded.
- [ ] Asset Tooling
- [ ] Pathfinding
- [ ] Generalize Mesh and Model rendering.
- [ ] Animation system
